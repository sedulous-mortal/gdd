        <h1>GALEWOOD</h1>
        <p>Overview of what type of game and style of play: Firstly, this has to be an RPG. Secondly, an MMO. Thirdly, I would like it to be in 3D and with a lot of landscape ideal for exploration.</p>
        <p>
            Explanation in detail about what your goal or objectives will be in bullets and a header for each section, in order of significance: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Positive Community Environment:</h3>
                <p>It’s a large problem in the millennial generation. We all hate on each other and bully each other, more so than the generations before us, probably in part because we are so attached to screen-time activities that do not involve opportunities to enjoy each other adequately. I am convinced that we can use screen-time addiction to our advantage, not only for profits but also to engage people in the personal growth that they need to better empathize with others. In consideration of this, I also think it’s important to ensure that people don’t become addicted to this game, as there will always be a surplus of activities they can be doing for experience or for profit in-game (much like World of Warcraft and other MMOs).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Fun:</h3>
                <p>I would like for people to experience the thrill of RNG working both in their favor at times (in the random drops they get as small objective-completion rewards) and against them (life events that force them to do more work but also give them the opportunity to get better at marketable skills). I want to create a very individualized experience by providing vast troves of different items as potential drops. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Profit:</h3>
                <p>I also want to look at exactly how dopamine works in the human brain and analyze the best ways to provide dopamine rushes through item drops possible. This is an area in which I feel many other MMOs fail, and in that sense there may be a niche in the market. I am unwilling (during alpha and beta at the very least) to allow for in-game advantage based on real-life monetary contribution through the shop. I do not want this game to be pay to win. (If you could even call hitting level cap winning). However, I think it is very important that we allow for people with the money to spare to indulge in extra skins, settings, and companions available only through the shop with real money. These items overall do not impact gameplay aside from minor aesthetic differences.</p>
                <li>
                    <h3>Acquisition of real-life skills:</h3>
                    <p>I would also like the details of taking care of negative in-game events to be very aligned with the real skills required to manage those events, e.g. accuracy when dealing with mold in your floorboards. Although I understand not everyone who plays the game is likely to actually use these skills in real life at any point, it still feels good (in my opinion) to reconnect to manual labor for those of us who do not do it in real life all that often. Developing critical thinking skills should also be a part of the game.</p>
                </li>

        <div id="progress">
            <p> How progress in the story or movement to the goal will actually accumulate: </p>
            <p>Starting out in the game, you will choose a role as Guardian, Game Hunter, or Gatherer. Game Hunter hunts and sells game, including skins, first skill is skinning. Guardian protects the homeland with snare, weapon, and fortification, first skill is building. Gatherer is like hunter, but gathers different things from the land, including plant life and random drops, first skill is herbalism.</p>
            <p> All players will have the further following skill set, which they can activate at any time by right-clicking on the correct in-game object(s):</p>
            <ul>
                <li></li> First Aid
                <li></li>Fishing
                <li></li>Mining
                <li></li>Harvesting
                <li></li>Planting
                <li></li>Bartering
                <li></li>Cooking
                <li></li>Exploring
            </ul>

            <p> As you move through the tutorial and into MMORPG mode, you will be asked to transition between PvE and PvP by feeding a player who is logged out, or tending their crops while they are away. This will set the tone for a viable and positive karma-earning community. </p>
            <p>First Aid is leveled by tending to wounded animals and yourself when you encounter an injury.</p>
            <p> Fishing is leveled by using a Fishing Rod at a pond or river.</p>
            <p> Mining is leveled by entering the Caves and picking at ores.</p>
            <p> Harvesting is leveled by right-clicking on interesting objects on the ground or in the trees in forests or alongside the road.</p>
            <p>Planting is leveled by planting your crops in your wheat field and garden behind your house.</p>
            <p> Bartering is leveled by trading with other players without the use of bits.</p>
            <p> Cooking is leveled by using the stove in your house or a campfire outside on just about anything. </p>
            <p> Exploring is leveled every time you enter a new area, and allows you to see more on your mini-map.</p>
            <p> Your overall level is determined by the addition of all of your skill levels, and decides where your housing is able to relocate to, in which area of Galewood.</p>

            <p> Bits should look sort of like this:</p>

        <div id="animations">
            <p>Explanation of how animations will work:</p>
            <p> Animations will be fluid and constant, and will allow for a sense that the player is navigating the 3D world in the first or third person. (Much like WoW) </p>
        </div>

        <div id="points">
            <h2> Every set of
               points systems needed for the game that a player will see:</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>Karma: There is no cap on how much of this you can get, and no bottom cap on how low yours can fall over time (though it is very hard to lose karma points other than with the time drain). Karma drains at 1 point per five minutes, both when offline and on. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Karma dynamic: increased chance of positive events and level if you donate the yield from a positive event to the community or to a particular player (but it must be a different player every time). </li>
                    <li>Events for which you can earn Karma include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 points: </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tending a random stranger’s crops, or harvesting their fruits and leaving them basketed at their door</li>
                            <li> Fixing a random stranger’s house</li>
                            <li> Feeding a random stranger’s ducks and fishies</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> 5 points: </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Feeding a stranger who is offline</li>
                            <li>Hydrating a stranger who is offline</li>
                            <li>Applying first aid to a stranger who is offline</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>Nourishment and Hydration:</li>
                <li>Each of these is out of 10 points.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nourishment declines at 1 point per hour when logged in, or 3 points per day when logged out. </li>
                    <li>Hydration declines at 2 points per hour when logged in, or 6 points per day when logged out.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Bits (the Galewood Currency):</li>
                <li>There is no cap on these either, but they are only exchangeable with NPCs, no players can trade items for bits with each other (yet). </li>
                <li>Damages to Your Stuff: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every five minutes (while logged in) there should be a roll with 1/500 chance each as to whether a minor negative event happens, and a 1/100 chance per hour while logged out.</li>
                    <li>Minor events:</li>
                    <li>Bunnies or deer eat your field of crops</li>
                    <li>It rains and your pond floods</li>
                    <li>Your fruit tree and the hay at its base are consumed by wildfire</li>
                    <li>Your bees get out of hand and attack you, stopping honey production for 30 minutes and causing you to do first aid</li>
                    <li>Every 12 hours a roll for major negative event with 33% (adjustable by your karma level) chance it happens while logged in, 66% chance while logged out, 50% chance you suffer consequences from the event, 50% chance your stuff takes no damages</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Major events:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tornado takes out pond and crops</li>
                    <li>Earthquake takes out your tree and house</li>
                    <li>A swarm of butterflies crowd into the honey refinery out back and kill the bees</li>

            <p>Obtainable from NPCs (example: A forest elf named Trey tells you to search for a key to his heart, which he lost when he became evil. When you find it, he steals 30 of your Karma but leaves you 30 bits.) </p>

            <p>PVP mini game is somewhat pay-to-win. You get plenty of PVP drops from the actual game, but the PVP gear sold in shop for real money is just a slight bit better. </p>
